# CCAPDEV

This project is a Five Nights at Freddy's themed laboratory reservation web application. Users may create accounts to reserve seats from three different laboratories: Freddy's Frightful Manor, Chica's Chilling Chamber, and Puppet's Perilous Palace. It is primarily built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

The web application can be accessed through the following link: https://ccapdev-jw8b.onrender.com/

To run locally:

1. Run the command "node create.js" in cmd. This will add the sample data. Afterwards, stop the terminal with ctrl + C.

2. Run the command "node index.js" in cmd. The project can now be accessed through localhost:3000.

3. To reset user data, run the command "node delete.js" in cmd. This will drop all data collections.
